INPUT FILE STRUCTURE:

KEYWORDS:

OPTIONS. After this keyword you need to specify which options do you want to consider in your calculations.
COULOMB. Space charge would be considered. Must be used after k\w OPTIONS.
REVERSE. Backward travelling wave regime would br considered. Must be used after k\w OPTIONS.
MAGNETIZED. The program will consider that input particles are emitted from cathode with magnetic field at z=0. Must be used after k\w OPTIONS.
Ex. OPTIONS COULMB REVERSE

SOLENOID. Specifies an exteranal magnetic field. 3 parameters needed: magnetic induction B[T], solenoid length L[m], solenoid position Z0[m]
Ex. SOLENOID 0.15 0.2 0
Custom magnetic field distribution can be imported from file. To do this, add the file name with field distribution after the keyword SOLENOID.
Ex. SOLENOID BFIELD.txt
The following input file format must be used: first column is z coordinate in [m], second is magnetic field in [Gs]. z-coordinates can be outside the simulation domain.

BEAM. Specifies input beam phase space parameters. 6 parameters needed: Average phase phi0[deg], phase spectrum dphi[deg], type of phase distribution (EQ for quiprobable, NORM to Gaussian), average kinetic energy W0[MeV], enery spectrum dW[MeV], type of phase distribution (EQ for quiprobable, NORM to Gaussian)
Ex. BEAM 90 20 EQ 0.8 0.1 NORM

CURRENT. Specifies other beam parameters. 5 parameters needed: Beam current I0[A], Number of Particles to simulate Np[], Twiss parameters alpha[], betta[cm/rad], emittance[cm*rad]
Ex. CURRENT 0.15 1000 2.2 2.8 0.004
The particles distribution in transverse phase space x-x' can be exported from the external file. In this case you add the file name  after the beam current value.
Ex. CURRENT 0.15 beam.txt
The following input file format must be used: first column is x coordinate in [m], second is transverse velocity in [m/s]. 

POWER. Specifies a power input for all following cells. 2 or 3 parameters needed: Input power P0[MW], Operating Frequency F0[MHz], phase dF [deg]
Ex. POWER 2.0 2856
Ex. POWER 4.5 5712 90

CELL. Specifies a cell. 5 parameters needed: Phase shift Th[deg], Phase velocity betta[], Normalized Electric Field Stregth E*lambda/sqrt(P)[Ohm^-1/2], Normalized attenuation alpha*lambda^3/2[m^1/2], Normalized aperture size Ra/lambda[]. If last 2 parameters are missing, the structure is considered to be a disk-loaded structure and these parameters are found from the experemental tables.
Ex. CELL 120 0.999 380.0 0.01 0.12
Ex. CELL 90 0.8 200.0 (for DLS with phase shift 90 or 120 deg ONLY!)

CELLS. Specifies a Number of identical cells. 6 parameters needed: Number of cells Nc[], parameters for CELL definition
Ex. CELLS 6 0.999 380.0 0.01 0.12

DRIFT. Specifies a drift tube. 2 parameters needed: Length L[cm], Aperture radius Ra[cm].
Ex. DRIFT 10.0 2.0

END. Specifies the end of file.

Any line with improper format will be ignored and not copied into the output file.
